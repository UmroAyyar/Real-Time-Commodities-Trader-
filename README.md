# Real-Time-Commodities-Trader-
1.	Real-time commodities trader based on sentiment analysis of Twitter data
2.	I use data from a data provider of tweets that make mention of Cobalt and the Congo. I then use the Open AI API to conduct real time positive negetive sentiment analysis. Then I make a Surver, that sends the data and my client that recived and based on the sentiment, Positive or negetive buys or shorts Cobalt futures. I get the cobalt price from an open source provider. Finally, I share a PnL at the end.
